# Python-Dash

This repository contains laboratory assignments completed as part of an IBM data analysis course.

Two of these assignments are presented here to illustrate examples of tasks and approaches learned during the course. Each entry includes a brief description and a screenshot demonstrating the application in action.

* [**Dash_wildfire.py**](Dash_wildfire.py): Interactive dashboard for analyzing wildfire statistics in Australia.

* [**flight_delay.py**](flight_delay.py): Visualization and analysis of flight delay causes.

These assignments are intended to showcase my skills in using Python and the Dash framework to build interactive analytical applications.
